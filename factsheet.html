### Mayday PAC supports Republican Walter Jones, NC-3 House general election:###

Republican Congressman Walter Jones prevailed over his most competitive challenge to date in the NC-3 Republican primary — his opponent was largely funded by outside money. He is now running against Marshall Adame, a retired Marine and former U.S. diplomat, in the general election. Jones has represented the third district for 10 terms.

__FACTS:__ Congressman Walter Jones is the [only Republican](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/23/walter-jones-taylor-griffin_n_5187262.html) House member who vocally supports changing the way elections are funded. He [called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R13_Ud0rSQw) [Citizens United](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R13_Ud0rSQw) "one of the worst decisions by the Supreme Court in my adult lifetime." Jones is proof that campaign finance reform is an issue that gains [traction on both sides of the aisle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R13_Ud0rSQw).

__FACTS:__ Congressman Jones is an original co-sponsor of the [Government By the People Act](http://www.publicampaign.org/blog/2014/02/21/republican-walter-jones-supports-government-people-act). Jones’ history of sponsoring legislation to get money out of politics includes the [Fair Elections Now Act](http://action.fairelectionsnow.org/fairelections) from 2008, which was reintroduced in the House in 2011. In 2013, he introduced H.R. 3466 or [No Political Funds for Personal Use](https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3466), a bill that would close the personal use loophole for all [political committees](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/22/republican-campaign-finance-reform_n_4324754.html).

### Mayday PAC supports Democrat Carol Shea-Porter, NH-1 House general election:###

Democrat Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter is running against Frank Guinta, the former incumbent who lost to Shea-Porter in 2012. The race has been rated as a "toss-up" by most major news organizations.

*__FACTS:__* Congresswoman Shea-Porter co-sponsored the [Government By the People Act](http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Carol_Shea-Porter_Government_Reform.htm). In addition, campaign finance reform is a cornerstone of her [re-election campaign](http://www.sheaporter.com/Issues/2012-08-campaign-finance-reform). Shea-Porter is a co-sponsor of the [Fair Elections Now Act](https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/269/cosponsors) and participated in the ["New Hampshire Rebellion"](http://blog.ted.com/2014/01/24/larry-lessig-completes-185-mile-walk-across-new-hampshire/) protest in 2014.

__FACTS:__ Guinta was named one of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington’s [Most Corrupt](http://www.crewsmostcorrupt.org/mostcorrupt/entry/frank-guinta) members of congress during his first term. He was [placed under federal investigation](http://www.citizensforethics.org/page/-/PDFs/Reports/Most Corrupt Reports/Guinta, Frank.pdf?nocdn=1) for irregularities in his 2010 campaign finances. In 2012, Guinta’s top donors included [Citizens United and Koch Industries](https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2012&cid=N00030801).

### Mayday PAC supports Democrat Reuben Gallego, AZ-7 primary election:###

Democrat Reuben Gallego is a former Arizona state representative running against Mary Rose Wilcox, the Maricopa County Supervisor. The district is currently represented by retiring democratic congressman Ed Pastor.

__FACTS:__ Gallego believes that the only way to get Washington working again is to take money out of politics. [He supports](http://gallegoforarizona.com/money-in-politics/) the Government by the People Act and a constitutional amendment that would overturn the Citizens United decision.

__FACTS:__ Gallego has received several high profile endorsements, including current Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz) who has received praise from the [Fair Elections Now Coalition](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fair-elections-now-coalition-praises-rep-raul-grijalva-for-cosponsoring-fair-elections-now-act-60778672.html) for co-sponsoring the Fair Elections Now Act. Grijalva endorsed Gallego in a [written statement](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/raul-grijalva-arizona-2014-primary-104818.html#ixzz39ofR6WmW), saying "I worked with Ed Pastor for many years. He was the best partner I could have asked for in Phoenix, and I couldn’t think of a better candidate to replace him than Ruben Gallego."

{:.no_toc}

### Mayday PAC supports Republican Jim Rubens, NH U.S. Senate primary:

Scott Brown and Jim Rubens are two leading candidates in the crowded field for the GOP nomination to challenge incumbent U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen.

__FACTS:__ Jim Rubens is campaigning on a 9-point [Political Reform Agenda](http://jimrubens.com/issues/agenda), including a plan to “enact a public elections financing system for candidates.” [He also has pledged to support the Taxation without Representation Act](http://reform.to/#/candidates/S4NH00112), which would create a public financing system for elections to diminish the power of big money in politics. The act would provide taxpayers up to $200 apiece in vouchers that they can sign over only to candidates they support, empowering everyday citizens.

__FACTS:__  Scott Brown [refused to co-sponsor](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c113:S.2023.IS:/) the Fair Elections Now Act, the public financing bill in the U.S. Senate. He was the [deciding vote](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm%3Fcongress=111%26session=2%26vote=00240) against the DISCLOSE Act, a crucial bill to increase donor transparency after the *Citizens United* ruling. After [agreeing](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/brown-warren-pledge-to-curb-outside-campaign-spending/2012/01/23/gIQAi4jbLQ_story.html) to a “People’s Pledge” to combat special-interest money in the Massachusetts Senate race, he [refuses to](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/24/scott-brown-senate_n_5018641.html) this year. Brown’s campaign is fueled by [special-interest money](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/03/scott-brown-new-hampshire-senate-jeanne-shaheen), including millions from Wall Street and financial interests.

### Mayday PAC supports Democrat Staci Appel, IA-3 House general election:

Democrat Staci Appel is running against David Young, a former aide to Sen. Chuck Grassley. Currently represented by a retiring Republican, President Obama won this district in 2012.

__FACTS:__  Staci Appel has [pledged to support](http://www.scribd.com/doc/235323586/Appel-Questionnaire-Democracy) a constitutional amendment to overturn the disastrous Citizens United ruling. She supports the Government By The People Act (public matching funds) – and, as State Senator, Appel sponsored legislation ([SSB 1173](https://coolice.legis.iowa.gov/Cool-ICE/default.asp?category=billinfo&service=dspldata&var=sbco&CFID=13&GA=82)) that would have established public financing of elections in Iowa for the first time.

__FACTS:__ Young is funded by big-money special interests based in Washington, DC.  The top contributing “industry” to Young’s campaign is [lobbyists, who have contributed $77,500](https://www.opensecrets.org/races/indus.php?cycle=2014&id=IA03&spec=N), more donors from DC have given to his campaign [than any other metropolitan area](https://www.opensecrets.org/races/geog.php?cycle=2014&id=IA03&spec=N), and he has more donors from out of state than from Iowa.
