Man: [0:01] If you're an American, then you believe we must find a way to reduce the influence of money in politics. But here's reality. The politicians aren't gonna fix this for us.

[0:11] The existing system is way too comfortable for them and their cronies and way too profitable. They won't fix it, so we must. We started the Mayday PAC to be a citizen-funded Super PAC to end all Super PACs by electing a Congress committed to fundamental reform by 2016.

[0:29] In the Republican primary, we're supporting Jim Rubens, the only conservative in the nation to make ending this cronyism a top issue. It takes real courage to be a Republican standing up to big money in Washington, and America needs that courage.

[0:45] So lead us, New Hampshire. Vote for Jim Rubens and show DC that the Republican base wants to end this corruption too.
