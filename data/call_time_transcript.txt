Man: [0:01] Hear that? That's the sound of politicians dialing for dollars, literally hours each day.

[0:07] They spend up to 70 percent of their time raising money, but they're not calling you and me. They're calling the tiniest fraction of America, no more than one-twentieth of one percent of us. That tiny fraction gets access to our elected officials. They make the laws. They call the shots.

[0:24] There is only one Republican candidate for the United States Senate in the nation, who has had the courage to take on this cronyism openly. Only one who has offered a plan for fixing it; New Hampshire's Jim Rubens. A businessman and fiscal conservative who one New Hampshire paper says may be just what the Republican Party needs.

[0:43] His courage is certainly what America needs. We can end this system of corruption, but only if New Hampshire leads. Vote for Jim Rubens on September 9th, in the Republican primary.
